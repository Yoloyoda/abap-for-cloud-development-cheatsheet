Cheatsheet for smooth adaptation to ABAP on Cloud
Original blog https://blogs.sap.com/2023/08/15/smooth-transition-to-abap-for-cloud-developmentcheat-sheet/

More and more organizations are coming across the term **ABAP on Cloud**. Whether they are considering **Side-by-Side Extension** with SAP Business Technology Platform or **On-stack Extension** in S4 HANA, Iâ€™m certain that this is discussed in your strategy meeting at least once.

ABAP on Cloud(aka **ABAP for Cloud Development** language version) is similar yet different from standard ABAP in many ways. Even if your organization holds in-house ABAP developers, the transition path to ABAP on Cloud may not be easy. This is due to the fact that certain APIs(table, function module, tcode, etc.) exist in your system built with standard ABAP language are not functional in ABAP on Cloud. On the front-end level, the major factor of not being able to use SAP GUI changes certain ABAP based solutions. In addition, there are changes in ABAP syntax as well.
